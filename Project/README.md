IoT traffic anomalies detection system: 
•	Perform dimension reduction and normalization on SimpleHome_XCS7_1002_WHT_Security_Camera dataset (BASHLITE, Mirai, no infection).
•	Do parameters tuning for DBSCAN and Kmeans to visualize the results on the dataset and explore the principles differences between these two algorithms.
•	Calculate error rate and draw confusion matrix.
