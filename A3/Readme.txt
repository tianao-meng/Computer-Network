1. Firstly, run the nfe.sh,for example,./nfe.sh localhost 2000 grading_topo.json. After running nfe file, run virtual_router.sh, for example,./virtual_rooter.sh localhost 2000 1. 
The number that you need to run the virtual router file is based on different topo.json files.

2. I run the nfe.sh and virtual_rooter.sh on ubuntu1804-002 to test my code.

3. I use python3 for this assignment.

4. I will not upload the topology_<routerID>.out file and routingtable_<routerID>.out file. When you run my code, they will be created.

5. Without KeyboardInterrupt, my virtual router will sit in forever loop, waiting for new useful messages.
