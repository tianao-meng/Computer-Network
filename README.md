# Computer_Network

In A1, I gain experience with socket programming and to implement a simple message board with a client and a server. The message server will store a list of messages and, upon request send those messages to a client. 

In A2,  I implement the Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol, which could be used to reliably transfer a text file from one host to another across an unreliable network. 

In A3, I implement a shortest path routing algorithm, much like the one found in Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). 

In EoT, I get hands-on experience by simulating a virtual network using Mininet.

The project is that I mentioned in my CV ,"Detection of IoT traffic anomalies based on unsupervised learning methods".
